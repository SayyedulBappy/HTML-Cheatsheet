		<!-- <object> Element
		The <object> element is supported by all browsers.

The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML:
		-->
		<object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>
		<object data="audi.jpeg"></object>

		<!-- <embed> Element
		The <embed> element is supported in all major browsers.

The <embed> element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

Web browsers have supported the <embed> element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5.
		-->

		<embed src="audi.jpeg" />
		<embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html" />
	</body>
</html>
